        "### 1-Tier Architecture (Single-Tier Architecture)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What:**\n",
        "In a 1-tier architecture, the entire application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, is contained in a single layer. All components run on a single machine or environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why:**\n",
        "- **Simplicity:** It's the simplest form of application architecture since everything is located in one place.\n",
        "- **Cost-effective:** Minimal infrastructure is required, as everything operates on a single device.\n",
        "- **Easier to develop and deploy:** Because the components are tightly coupled, it's straightforward to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How:**\n",
        "A typical example is a desktop application like Microsoft Word or an older accounting application, where the database and application logic run locally on a user's computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "Consider a basic standalone application such as a simple text editor. The application has:\n",
        "1. A **User Interface** (e.g., text input box).\n",
        "2. **Business Logic** (e.g., methods for saving, opening, editing files).\n",
        "3. **Data Access Layer** (file system on the local machine).\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything is executed and stored locally, with no server interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2-Tier Architecture (Client-Server Architecture)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What:**\n",
        "In a 2-tier architecture, the application is split into two main layers: the **client layer** (user interface) and the **server layer** (which includes both the business logic and the database).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why:**\n",
        "- **Scalability:** The database is separated from the user interface, which can be located on different machines.\n",
        "- **Centralized data storage:** All the data resides on the server, allowing multiple clients to access it.\n",
        "- **Better security and control:** The server can implement security protocols and access control for the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How:**\n",
        "The client sends requests to the server, which processes them and sends back the results. The business logic and database interaction happen on the server side, while the user interface remains on the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "Consider a **desktop application** (client) that interacts with a **centralized database** (server). A user fills out a form in the application (client), which sends the data to a server. The server processes the information, performs validation, and updates the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Client:** User interface for interacting with the server (e.g., a booking system or a simple web application where the logic is processed on the backend).\n",
        "- **Server:** Holds the business logic and database (e.g., a MySQL or SQL Server database).\n",

        "### 3-Tier Architecture (Presentation, Application, and Data Layers)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What:**\n",
        "In a 3-tier architecture, the application is divided into three separate layers:\n",
        "1. **Presentation Layer (UI):** Handles user interface and user experience.\n",
        "2. **Application Layer (Business Logic):** Contains the business logic of the application, often referred to as the middleware.\n",
        "3. **Data Layer (Database):** Responsible for data access and storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why:**\n",
        "- **Modularity:** Each layer is independent, making the application easier to maintain and extend.\n",
        "- **Scalability:** Different layers can be scaled independently (e.g., adding more database servers or optimizing the business logic layer).\n",
        "- **Reusability:** Business logic and data access components can be reused by multiple interfaces (e.g., mobile apps, web apps).\n",
        "- **Separation of concerns:** Each layer is dedicated to a specific responsibility, improving the overall design and manageability of the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How:**\n",
        "In a 3-tier architecture, the presentation layer communicates with the business logic layer (application layer), which then interacts with the data layer (database).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "Consider an **e-commerce website** that follows a 3-tier architecture.\n",
        "- **Presentation Layer:** The user browses products and places orders through a web browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).\n",
        "- **Application Layer:** The business logic on the server processes the orders, calculates totals, handles payment, and checks inventory. This could be a Python/Django or Node.js application running on a server.\n",
        "- **Data Layer:** The application queries the database to check product availability, user accounts, and transaction records. The database could be something like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.\n",
        "\n",

        "### Key Benefits:\n",
        "- **1-Tier:** Good for local applications and systems where interaction with a server isn’t required.\n",
        "- **2-Tier:** Suitable for small to medium applications that require a database to be accessed from multiple clients.\n",
        "- **3-Tier:** Best for complex, enterprise-level applications with high modularity, scalability, and reusability requirements.\n",

        "Normalization is a process in database design used to organize data in such a way that reduces redundancy and improves data integrity. The primary goal of normalization is to divide large tables into smaller, related tables and define relationships between them. This helps to eliminate redundant data (repeating data) and ensure data dependencies are logical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization is typically done in multiple stages, known as **Normal Forms** (NF). Each successive form removes types of redundancy and anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Normal Forms**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**\n",
        "- **What:** Ensures that each table contains only atomic (indivisible) values and that each record is unique.\n",
        "- **Why:** To eliminate repeating groups or arrays and ensure that all values in a column are of the same data type.\n",
        "- **How:**\n",
        "  - Each table has a primary key.\n",
        "  - Each field contains only atomic values (e.g., no lists or sets in a field).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**\n",
        "- **What:** Achieved when a table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key (i.e., no partial dependency).\n",
        "- **Why:** To remove partial dependencies, where some attributes depend on part of a composite key.\n",
        "- **How:**\n",
        "  - The table must already be in 1NF.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**\n",
        "- **What:** Achieved when a table is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are dependent only on the primary key (i.e., no transitive dependency).\n",
        "- **Why:** To eliminate transitive dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes.\n",
        "- **How:**\n",
        "  - The table must already be in 2NF.\n",

        "#### 4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**\n",
        "- **What:** A stricter version of 3NF, where every determinant is a candidate key.\n",
        "- **Why:** To handle cases where 3NF is not sufficient due to certain anomalies.\n",
        "- **How:**\n",
        "  - The table must already be in 3NF.\n",

        "- **What:** Achieved when a table is in BCNF and contains no multivalued dependencies.\n",
        "- **Why:** To eliminate multivalued dependencies, which occur when one attribute in a table uniquely determines another attribute, but the attributes are independent of each other.\n",
        "- **How:**\n",
        "  - The table must already be in BCNF.\n",

        "- **Maintains data integrity:** Enforces relationships between tables using foreign keys.\n",
        "- **Improves query performance:** Smaller tables with well-defined relationships lead to optimized queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Disadvantages of Normalization**\n",
        "- **Complex joins:** Normalization can result in more tables, which can make querying the database more complex due to the need for multiple joins.\n",
        "- **Performance trade-offs:** For highly normalized databases, retrieval times can increase because of the need to join multiple tables.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **When Not to Normalize**\n",

        "ACID Properties\n",
        "In the context of databases, **ACID properties** are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. Each letter in \"ACID\" stands for a key aspect of these transactions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Atomicity**\n",
        "   - **What:** Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit, meaning all operations within the transaction are either fully completed or fully rolled back.\n",
        "   - **Why:** If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database remains in its previous state, avoiding partial updates.\n",
        "   - **How:** If a bank transfer involves debiting one account and crediting another, both operations must succeed or neither will.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:** If you're transferring $100 from Account A to Account B and the credit to Account B fails after the debit from Account A, atomicity ensures the debit is reversed, so the $100 is not lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency**\n",
        "   - **What:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining the database’s rules and integrity constraints.\n",
        "   - **Why:** To ensure that data remains accurate and adheres to business rules and constraints, even after a transaction is performed.\n",
        "   - **How:** Constraints like foreign keys, unique constraints, and triggers ensure that even after a transaction, the data remains consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:** If a transaction updates a table, it should not violate foreign key constraints or other rules like balance limits in a banking system.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Isolation**\n",
        "   - **What:** Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation, meaning the intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions. Each transaction operates as if it’s the only one running, preventing concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.\n",
        "   - **Why:** To prevent race conditions and ensure that the result of multiple transactions is the same as if they were executed sequentially, even if they are run concurrently.\n",
        "   - **How:** Different isolation levels (e.g., Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) control how much data one transaction can see from another transaction in progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:** In an e-commerce application, two customers shouldn't be able to purchase the last available item at the same time due to a lack of isolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Durability**\n",
        "   - **What:** Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved in the database, even in the event of a system failure (e.g., crash, power loss).\n",
        "   - **Why:** To guarantee that completed transactions are not lost due to system failures.\n",
        "   - **How:** Databases use techniques like logging, checkpoints, and backups to ensure the durability of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:** After a successful bank transfer, the changes to both accounts should remain even if the database server crashes immediately after the transaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **ACID in a Banking Example**\n",
        "Let's take an example of transferring $500 from Account A to Account B:\n",
        "1. **Atomicity:** If $500 is debited from Account A but the credit to Account B fails, the transaction is rolled back, ensuring no partial updates.\n",
        "2. **Consistency:** After the transaction, the total amount of money in both accounts should remain the same as before the transaction (e.g., $500 is moved from one account to another, keeping the total money consistent).\n",
        "3. **Isolation:** If another transaction is trying to read the balances during the transfer, it will not see the intermediate state where $500 has been debited but not yet credited.\n",
        "4. **Durability:** Once the transfer is complete and committed, it remains so, even if the system crashes right after.\n",

        "### **Importance of ACID Properties**\n",
        "- **Data Integrity:** They ensure the accuracy and reliability of data.\n",

        "- **What:** A **correlated query** is a type of subquery that refers to columns from the outer query. Unlike a simple subquery, a correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, meaning the inner query depends on the outer query.\n",
        "- **Why:** Correlated queries are useful when each row of the outer query needs to be compared with rows from the inner query, such as when checking for conditions in a related dataset.\n",

        "Indexing\n",
        "### **Indexing in Databases**\n",
        "\n",
        "**What:**  \n",
        "Indexing is a technique used in databases to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. An index is created on one or more columns of a table to allow for faster access to rows, without having to search every row in the table sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:**  \n",
        "Indexes are crucial for enhancing database performance, especially for large datasets. They allow the database to find and retrieve the requested data much faster than scanning the entire table.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How:**  \n",
        "When an index is created on a table column (or columns), the database creates a separate data structure (usually a B-tree or hash table) that stores the values of the indexed columns and pointers to the corresponding rows in the table. This allows the database to look up the indexed value and directly access the rows, rather than scanning the entire table.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Indexing Works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Without Index:**  \n",
        "   When no index is present, the database has to perform a **full table scan** to retrieve the requested data. This means examining every row in the table, which can be slow, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Employee_ID = 123;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   If `Employee_ID` is not indexed, the database will check every row to find a match.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **With Index:**  \n",
        "   When an index is created on a column, the database uses the index to quickly locate the rows that match the query, reducing the number of rows it needs to search.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   CREATE INDEX idx_emp_id ON Employees(Employee_ID);\n",
        "   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Employee_ID = 123;\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Increased Storage:**  \n",
        "   Indexes take up additional disk space. A table with many indexes requires more storage as each index is stored separately from the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Slower Write Operations:**  \n",
        "   Insertion, update, and delete operations become slower on indexed tables because the index needs to be updated every time the table is modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maintenance Overhead:**  \n",

        "- **Low Selectivity Columns:** Columns with few unique values (low cardinality) are generally not good candidates for indexing (e.g., `Gender` column in a table where values are just `M` or `F`). A **bitmap index** may be useful in such cases, but typical indexes won't provide much benefit.\n",

        "Sharding\n",
        "What:\n",
        "Sharding is a database scaling technique where data is horizontally partitioned across multiple servers, called shards.\n",
        "Why:\n",
        "Sharding is used to manage large datasets and improve database performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.\n",
        "How:\n",
        "Data is split based on a sharding key, distributing rows across multiple shards. Each shard holds a subset of the entire dataset, reducing the load on individual servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Sharding:\n",
        "Range-Based Sharding: Data is partitioned based on a range of values (e.g., user ID ranges).\n",
        "Hash-Based Sharding: A hash function distributes data across shards evenly.\n",
        "Geographic Sharding: Data is partitioned by geographic location.\n",
        "Directory-Based Sharding: A lookup table determines which shard holds specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "Improved Performance: Reduces load on individual servers.\n",
        "Scalability: Allows for horizontal scaling by adding more shards.\n",
        "Fault Tolerance: Failure of one shard doesn't affect the entire system.\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "Complex Queries: Cross-shard queries can be slow and complex.\n",
        "Data Rebalancing: Requires manual intervention as data grows.\n",
        "Consistency: Ensuring consistency across shards can be difficult.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A large e-commerce application shards its Orders table by User_ID, distributing users across multiple database servers to handle large volumes of data efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Triggers\n",
        "What:\n",
        "A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to specific events on a table or view, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.\n",
        "Why:\n",
        "Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, audit changes, or automate complex tasks that occur when data in a table is modified.\n",
        "How:\n",
        "Triggers are attached to tables and executed automatically when the specified event (e.g., inserting a new row) occurs. They can be defined to run before or after the event, depending on the use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Triggers:\n",
        "Before Triggers: Execute before the data-modifying event occurs.\n",
        "After Triggers: Execute after the data-modifying event occurs.\n",
        "Instead of Triggers: Used to replace the standard action for events, often on views.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "Automatic Execution: Triggers run automatically, reducing manual intervention.\n",
        "Data Integrity: Enforces rules like constraints, ensuring valid data is always entered.\n",
        "Auditing: Automatically logs changes to data for security and auditing purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A trigger that logs changes to the Employees table:\n",
        "sql\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "CREATE TRIGGER log_changes\n",

        "Views\n",
        "What:\n",
        "A view is a virtual table in a database that is based on a SELECT query. It doesn't store data itself but displays data from one or more underlying tables.\n",
        "Why:\n",
        "Views are used to simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting data access, and provide a customized representation of data for different users or purposes.\n",
        "How:\n",
        "Views are created using a SELECT query, and when the view is queried, the underlying query is executed to fetch the data from the original tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Views:\n",
        "Simple View: Based on a single table without complex joins or functions.\n",
        "Complex View: Involves multiple tables, joins, and aggregate functions.\n",
        "Materialized View: Stores the result set physically, improving performance for frequently accessed queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "Simplifies Queries: Provides an abstraction over complex queries.\n",
        "Security: Restricts access to sensitive data by limiting which columns or rows are visible.\n",
        "Data Independence: Underlying table changes do not affect the view structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A view to show basic employee information:\n",
        "sql\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "CREATE VIEW Employee_View AS\n",
        "SELECT Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department\n",
        "FROM Employees\n",
        "WHERE Department = 'Sales';\n",
        "This view shows only employees in the Sales department and can be queried like a table:\n",
